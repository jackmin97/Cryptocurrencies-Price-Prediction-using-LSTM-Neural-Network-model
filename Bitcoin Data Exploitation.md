# 1. Import the libraries


```python
# First we will import the necessary Library 

import os 
import pandas as pd 
import numpy as np 
import math 
import datetime as dt

# For evaluation we will use these library 

from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error, explained_variance_score, r2_score
from sklearn.metrics import mean_poisson_deviance, mean_gamma_deviance, accuracy_score
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

# For model building we will use these library

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential 
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM

# For Plotting we will use these library

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
from itertools import cycle 
import plotly.graph_objects as go 
import plotly.express as px
from plotly.subplots import make_subplots

```

# 2. Loading Dataset


```python
# Load our dataset

maindf = pd.read_csv('BTC-USD.lstm.csv')
```


```python
print('Total number of days present in the dataset:',maindf.shape[0])
print('Total number of fields present in the dataset:',maindf.shape[1])
```

    Total number of days present in the dataset: 609
    Total number of fields present in the dataset: 7
    


```python
maindf.shape
```




    (609, 7)




```python
maindf.head()
```
